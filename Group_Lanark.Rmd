Write and implement code (modifying code already given to you in the lecture notes e.g. the
two sample randomisation test), to obtain a jackknife estimate for the standard error of the 
mean for seal body length, using the seals data set (seals.csv).

I.e., sampling without replacement.

                        The Jackknife:

The jackknife works only for statistics that are smooth functions of the data. Statistics
that are not smooth functions of the data, such as quantiles, may yield inconsistent 
jackknife estimates. The best results are obtained with statistics that are linear 
functions of the data. For highly nonlinear statistics, the jackknife can be inaccurate.
